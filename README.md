Sensing under the Hamiltonian of Stark Model:

1- Time evolution of an initial state under the Hamiltonian of Stark model for single- and multi-particle.
 
2- Considering the Quantum Fisher information (QFI) for single- and multi-particle.

3- Finding the scaling of the QFI concerning the system size L and number of excitations N.

3- Impact of the decoherence on the QFI.

4- Implementation of maximum likelihood estimation.
